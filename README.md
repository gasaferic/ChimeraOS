### What is ChimeraOS

ChimeraOS is essentially a Xubuntu installation with pre-installed all services and Hidden Services to "survive" anonimously in this connected world.

This Project provide two types of software:

A VM (OVA format), with the Server and Hidden Services pre-configured.

A Windows Client (a Tor Browser installation) with pre-configured Hidden Service link to access directly to Server.

### Why ChimeraOS?

Because setting up an entire environment can be painful, so i decided to write my own environment and release to all.

##### You have control!

With this configuration, you have immediatly the SERVER! All your data belongs to you, and only to you!

##### You have security!

The entire environment is built with the latest release of all packets, no upgrades from previous versions.

This means you have the latest features and patch and you don't have to download hundreds of updates.

##### You decide!

You have the full control of your environment. Every single packet is in initial state, exept for Tor Hidden Service.
I decided to setup an Hidden service to provide an example of Server and Client configuration.

To secure your Hidden Service, delete the Hidden Service folder at "/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/", so Tor can generate a new Hidden Service v3.

The credentials for Login and "sudo" commands are:

Username: ubuntu

Password: ubuntu

Make sure to change it, and apply all the best practices to manage your server installation!

##### ALL VM CONNECTIONS ARE REDIRECTED THROUGH TOR!

Make sure you remember this...

##### ENJOY!

Open an issue for problems or implementations requests.

For now i will host the VM and Client to Google Drive: i haven't encrypted the VM Hard Disk, you can inspect every single file, and load a VM in a isolated environment, if you have strong security measures.

The Client is a simple zip file with Tor Browser Bundle, you can inspect every single file of the Client or view connections in an isolated environment, if you have strong security measures.

I hope you like this!


# Enjoy the most open and secure (and usable with no pain!) platform in the world! :)
