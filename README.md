# Welcome to my project!

### This project aims to make easier for users to deploy their own Tor Relays and Tor Hidden Services with Docker.

In the first section, i will explain the Tor Relay image, how to use and how to run easily your first Tor Relay.
The second section is dedicated to run your hidden service with released images of the OS released by this project (formerly the ChimeraOS).

For now, as i am on Windows, i will explain the use of images from Windows.

Very soon, i will release in the sections, the use of images and explain them for Ubuntu users.
